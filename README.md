# MultiGrain
MultiGrain is a neural network architecture solving both image classification and image retrieval tasks.

## Examples
...

## Requirements
MultiGrain requires
* Python 3.5 or higher
* Pytorch 1.0 or higher

and the requirements highlighted in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

The requirements can be installed:
* Ether by setting up a dedicated conda environment: `conda env create -f environment.yml` followed by `source activate multigrain`
* Or with pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

* Training

`scripts/train.py`...

* Input size fine-tuning of GeM exponent

`scripts/finetune_p.py` determines the optimal `p` for a given input size by fine-tuning.

* Whitening
`scripts/whiten.py` computes a PCA whitening and modifies the network accordingly.

* Evaluation
`scripts/eval.py` evaluates the network on standard benchmarks.
